- License change from BSD to Apache 2
- Removed encryption feature (it was standard-based but very custom)
- Read-only mode is performed via the `query_only` PRAGMA
- Even if the database is read only, it's possible to perform init macros
- YAML file, when explicitly given, is separated with a "::" from the db file/name (to solve ambiguities in windows)
- Stored Statements are now prefixed with `^`, not `#`, because it can be used in macros that are defined in the YAML file, where `#` would be a comment
- ScheduledTasks are replaced with the new macro and backup subsystems
    - Avoid use of scheduler logic, as it is very language-dependent and may be different from cron, with which the user is probably familiar
- The '%s' in the backup template is optional
- The backup files' pattern is specified as a backup directory, being intended that all the files in it are subject to deletion
- HTTP authentication is now named HTTP_BASIC (possible future JWT implementation)
- disableWALMode is now a more generic journalMode, for when WAL2 will be released
- it is possible to specify the index file when serving a directory
